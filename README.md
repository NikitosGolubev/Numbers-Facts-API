# My memories

Well, I want to become FullStack developer and in fact, I like Back-end more. But somehow, there was only one back-end project in my portfolio although I've been learning back-end techs for quite long. Why so? Well, in fact I had a great experience before developing social network(took more than 9 months), also I've developed a site - pdf-printer with price-tags for my sister, also I have some small projects. But most of them were written at the time before I read a book about clean code and I'm just ashamed to post them in my portfolio now, because they have no comments, their code is pretty awful time to time, it's just not that quality I wish. So, in 2019 I've set a goal to myself to expand the amount of worthful back-end projects in my portfolio. And this is first one. I just want to show, that I can produce quality and merely good software. So this is the starting point for me.

If you would compare my previous back-end project and this one, you would definitely notice significant positive changes as well as my progress. I've started using autogenerator of documentation for both Javascript and PHP. Also, I've read a book about patterns of programming and dived into SOLID principles so I try to master my ability to build good architectures. I think they are still far from perfect but with practise, I will definitely improve this skill.

Also, as you can see, I've used micro-framework Lumen here. Before this project, I've had a tiny no-serious experience with Laravel (I didn't even know how to assign a route in fact). But during developing I've started find out the details I need and appling them right away. It was a great experience when I had no clue about technology on which my project is based and when at the end of it I can certainly name myself a solid begginer in Laravel framework. (I will try to impove particularly in this field. I loved Laravel.)

Most importantly, I've derived an impactful lesson from this project. ***If you want to become good at something, you should be in love with pain that would definetely will occure, that's the only way to finally stay in love with proccess. If you like only final results, than you should rethink you approach towards the work that you do. May be you should change the way you're moving.*** I've ascertained for myself that I definetely love coding, cuz I remember the pain, remember the struggle at the beggining and *remember the feel of victory when I overcame it and coding process started feeling awesome*. Just unforgettable. **And yeah, it's better to NOT AVOID pain, it's better to LOOK FOR IT. Cuz pain leads to improvement.**

It was inspiring and I'm sure crucial project for me, not only because the practise and experience I delivered but also due to cognitive lesson I learned.
