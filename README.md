# My memories
Well, I want to become FullStack web developer and in fact, I prefer back-end over front-end. However somehow, there was only one back-end project in my portfolio so far although I've been learning back-end techs for quite long. 

Why so? Well, in fact, I had a great experience earlier developing a social network(took more than 9 months), also I've developed a site - pdf-printer with price-tags for my sister and I have other small projects. But most of them were written at the time before I read a book about clean code and now I'm just ashamed to post them in my portfolio because they have no comments, their code is pretty awful time to time, they are just not that quality I wish. 

So, in 2019 I've set a goal to myself to expand the number of worthful back-end projects in my portfolio. And this is the first one. I just want to show, that I can produce quality and merely good software. So this is the starting point for me.

If you would compare my previous back-end project and this one, you would definitely notice significant positive changes as well as my progress. I've started using auto generator of documentation for both Javascript and PHP. Also, I've read a book about patterns of programming and dived into SOLID principles so I try to master my ability to build good, flexible architectures. I think they are still far from perfect but with practice, I will definitely improve in that field.

Also, as you can see, I've used a micro-framework Lumen here. Before this project, I've had a tiny, no-serious experience with Laravel (I didn't even remember how to assign a route in fact). But during developing I've started to searching the details I needed and applying them right away.

It was great to realize the progress I made,  when at the beginning I had no clue about technology on which my project is based and when at the end of it I could certainly call myself a solid beginner in Laravel framework. (I will try to improve particularly in this field further. I love Laravel now.)

Most importantly, I've derived an impactful lesson from this project. ***If you want to become good at something, you should be in love with pain that would definitely occur, that's the only way to finally stay in love with the process. If you like only the final results, then you should rethink your approach towards the work that you do. Maybe you should change the way you're moving along.*** I've ascertained for myself that I definitely love coding, cuz I remember the pain, remember the struggle at the beginning and *remember the feel of victory when I overcame it and coding process started feeling awesome.* Just unforgettable. **And yeah, it's better to LOOK FOR pain, rather than AVOID IT. Cuz pain leads to improvement.**

It was inspiring and I'm sure a crucial project for me, not only because of the practice and experience I delivered but also due to the cognitive lesson I learned.

# Project description
Well, I wanted to develop a clone of http://numbersapi.com. So, of course, my API here is far more simple but It still demanded lots of effort from me to build it.

I've used both front-end and back-end knowledge here. As I've recently read the book about patterns I've decided to implement MVC in javascript here (you can also see that I've used Observer pattern as an essential part of MVC). My purpose was to make my code better and cleaner than it was before. I've tried to follow SOLID principles(at back-end). Unfortunately, I don't know now how not to break "Single responsibility" and "open-closed" principles cuz I haven't got ability to include files in front-end javascript(btw, I know that this feature was already added to front-end JS, I haven't still googled its usage, I'll eliminate this flaw in further projects in near future).
